                    <p>hi, my name is cecilia ljungquist and im a 32 years old frontend developer and web designer in the making. i was borned and raised in karlstad, värmland, 
                        but ive spent almost ten years in gothenburg so one could say that im 1/3 håkan hellström and 2/3 sven erik magnusson. today i live in malmö, but id have to admit that there is zero zlatan in me (unfortunetly).
                    </p>

                <p>im currently on my second semester of four to become a junior frontend developer. so far, the journey has been amazing. 
                    i think i wrote my first line of code in januari 2022 in matlab while 
                    i was studing construction engineering (at the time i was still confused about chosing my career). since then the list of discoveries has become quite long, but the biggest of them all is how much i 
                    absolutely love the craftmanship that frontend development holds, which for me means the perfect mix between visual creativity and logic.
