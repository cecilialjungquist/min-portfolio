            <p>here is a collection of projects that ive worked with so far. some of the projects are assignments connected to my education, and some ive done just because its fun.
                 there is more to see, but as we all know - the cognitive load needs to be balanced. please, dont hesitate to ask if there is anything you want to know more about!

                        <p>yes, its obvious, but i really feel it deserves a spot, haha. this page has been a great way for me to try new things and also keep track of my own development.</p>
                        <p>there are definetly earlier parts here that i would like to apporach in a different way today, parts where i now have a bigger understanding about what and how.</p>
                        <p>my next big thing with this page is probably to redo it with react! definetly a fun challenge ahead.</p>
                        <p>this page is an open and first draft of my future portfolio, which will be updated along my journey.</p>

                        <p>i also created a game as a level up, and made it possible for the user to save favorite planets with local storage. my biggest take-away from this project was how to create a livesearch with JS.</p>

                        <P>this was a really good challenge for me at the time, because i got to try and learn how to work with event listeners, inputs and conditions for input value.</P>
